# RAA Python scripts!
Some helper scripts to expedite tedious tasks. Productivity!

Some scripts can be run in the terminal, others will need to be slightly modified prior to running (eg. change paths, etc.). Hopefully the latter can be cleaned up & made more user-friendly...

### Basic style guide:
camelCase for all dirs, modules, non-class names
PascalCase for all classes
